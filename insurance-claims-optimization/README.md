# Insurance Claims Processing Optimization

## Overview
This project analyses and redesigns an end-to-end insurance claims process using BPMN 2.0.  
It is based on real operational experience in life insurance claims and finance functions.

The objective was to reduce turnaround time, minimise rework, and strengthen risk and compliance controls.

## Business Context
Insurance claims processing involves multiple stakeholders, high transaction volumes, and strict policy and regulatory requirements.  
I previously worked in claims processing and accounts administration, which provided firsthand exposure to operational bottlenecks, rework loops, and compliance challenges.

This project applies business analysis techniques to a realistic claims process to identify improvement opportunities and propose a structured TO-BE solution.

## Problem Statement
The AS-IS claims process faced several challenges:
- High rework due to incomplete or incorrect documentation
- Manual processing bottlenecks under high claim volumes
- Late identification of invalid or high-risk claims
- Limited separation between operational processing and compliance activities

These issues negatively impacted turnaround time, customer experience, and operational risk.

---

## Approach
The process was modelled using BPMN 2.0 to create a clear, end-to-end view of activities, decision points, and handoffs across customers, claims officers, systems, finance, and compliance teams.

The analysis focused on:
- Identifying rework loops and bottlenecks
- Highlighting key decision points and risk controls
- Clarifying roles and responsibilities across the process

---

## TO-BE Improvements
Based on the analysis, a redesigned TO-BE process was proposed with the following improvements:

- **Early document completeness validation** to reduce downstream rework
- **Automated policy validation** to prevent unnecessary processing of invalid claims
- **Risk-based post-loss investigation** to prioritise high-risk cases without delaying low-risk claims
- **Clear separation of assessment and compliance activities** using parallel flows
- **Improved role clarity and accountability** across operational and control functions

## Expected Outcomes
- Estimated 15–25% reduction in claim turnaround time
- Reduced rework and manual handling effort
- Improved customer experience and predictability
- Stronger audit and regulatory readiness
- Better management visibility through defined decision points

# Insurance Claims Processing Optimization (BPMN 2.0)

## Overview
This project presents a BPMN 2.0 redesign of an insurance claims processing workflow, from claim notification to payment or repudiation. The focus is on improving turnaround time, reducing rework, and strengthening operational risk and compliance controls.

The process design is based on practical exposure to life insurance claims and finance operations and reflects real-world decision points, controls, and handoffs.

## Objectives
- Reduce claim processing delays caused by rework
- Improve early detection of invalid or high-risk claims
- Clarify roles and responsibilities across claims, finance, and compliance
- Strengthen auditability and regulatory readiness

---

## Key Improvements
- Early document completeness validation with controlled rework loops
- Policy and coverage validation before detailed assessment
- Risk-based post-loss investigation for high-risk claims
- Parallel post-payment compliance and audit review
- Clear separation of operational and control activities using swimlanes
